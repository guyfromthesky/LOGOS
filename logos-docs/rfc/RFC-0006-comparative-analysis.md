# RFC-0006: Comparative Analysis

*   **Status**: Draft
*   **Category**: Analysis

## 1. Agent Frameworks (e.g., LangChain)

**Optimize for flexibility**
*   Rely on runtime checks

**LOGOS:**
*   Optimizes for constraints
*   Enforces architecture at compile time

## 2. Durable Execution (e.g., Temporal)

**Workflow defined in code**
*   Mutable logic

**LOGOS:**
*   Workflow defined as data
*   Immutable logic artifacts

## 3. Smart Contracts (EVM)

**Global consensus**
*   High latency

**LOGOS:**
*   Federated trust
*   Audit-focused execution

## 4. Summary

LOGOS trades flexibility for correctness, security, and auditability.
